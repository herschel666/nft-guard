## Installation

Install the package from the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nft-guard):

```sh
npm install --save nft-guard

# or

yarn add nft-guard
```

## Usage

Include the package into your JS bundle:

```js
// ESM
import 'nft-guard';

// CommonJS
require('nft-guard');
```

This registers the custom element `<nft-guard>`. You can now start using it in your HTML:

```html
<figure>
  <nft-guard>
    <img src="my-precious-nft.jpg" alt="" />
  </nft-guard>
</figure>
```

That's it! You're save now, evil persons going nuts on their right mouse-button won't be able to
steal your NFTs anymore. Enjoy your decentralized life. üòé
